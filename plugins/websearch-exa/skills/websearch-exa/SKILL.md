name: websearch-exa
description: Use web search when dealing with code, external libraries, APIs, libs or dependencies to get the correct params and prop names, and web search the correct methods and syntax. Use web search for code patterns, and best practices to find the most sustainable approach. Search the web when tasks or bug fixing turn out to be dificullt than expected or when the user shows frustration. Web search is great for finding version-specific documentation for external dependencies not already present in the code or docs.

# Exa Web Search

> **CRITICAL: Tool Selection Rules**
>
> 1. **For code-related searches:** Always use `get_code_context_exa`. This is the absolute best and preferred method for any code, API, library, or technical documentation search. It returns dense, highly relevant code snippets.
>
> 2. **For general web searches:** Use `web_search_exa` — it returns content directly with search results (highlights). Only follow up with `web_fetch_exa` if highlights are insufficient.
>
> 3. **Avoid `web_fetch_exa` during searches.** Only use it when the user explicitly provides a specific URL to fetch, or when another document references it or when searches need expansion.

## Overview

Exa provides code-optimized web search with dense, relevant code snippets. Use for API lookups, code examples, error debugging, and technical documentation.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_code_context_exa` | Code-specific search (GitHub, StackOverflow, docs) |
| `web_search_exa` | General web search (returns highlights automatically) |
| `web_fetch_exa` | Fetch full page content (only when URL is explicitly provided) |

## When to Use Which Tool

| Query Type | Tool | Why |
|------------|------|-----|
| API/SDK usage, code examples | `get_code_context_exa` | Returns dense, relevant code snippets |
| Library documentation | `get_code_context_exa` | Searches GitHub, StackOverflow, docs |
| Debugging errors | `get_code_context_exa` | Finds StackOverflow solutions |
| General web research | `web_search_exa` | Returns highlights automatically |
| Expand on search result | `web_fetch_exa` | When highlights aren't enough |
| Specific URL provided by user | `web_fetch_exa` | Fetches full page content |

## Version Awareness (Critical)

Before searching, determine which version of a library/API you're working with:

1. Check `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, etc.
2. Look at existing imports and usage patterns in the codebase
3. **Always include the version in your search query**

**Bad:** "React useEffect cleanup"
**Good:** "React 18 useEffect cleanup"

**Bad:** "Stripe create customer API"
**Good:** "Stripe API v2024-12 create customer Python"

## Query Tips for `get_code_context_exa`

**Always include version numbers:**
- Check the project's dependencies first
- Include major version: "React 18 useEffect" not "React useEffect"
- Include API version if applicable: "Stripe API 2024-12 webhooks"

**Be specific with context:**
- Include language: "Stripe webhook signature verification Python"
- Include framework: "NextAuth v5 Google OAuth app router"
- Include environment: "AWS Lambda Node 20 cold start optimization"

## What Exa Searches

- GitHub repositories (1B+ files)
- Official documentation sites
- StackOverflow questions and answers
- Technical blog posts

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Searching without version | Always check and include library version |
| Using `web_search_exa` for code | Use `get_code_context_exa` for code queries |
| Using `web_fetch_exa` to search | Only use when a specific URL is provided or to expand highlights |
| Vague queries | Be specific: language, framework, version |
| Not checking project deps first | Always check package.json/requirements.txt first |
