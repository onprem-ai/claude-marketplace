description: Use web search when dealing with code, external libraries, APIs, libs or dependencies to get the correct params and prop names, and web search the correct methods and syntax. Use web search for code patterns, and best practices to find the most sustainable approach. Search the web when tasks or bug fixing turn out to be dificullt than expected or when the user shows frustration. Web search is great for finding version-specific documentation for external dependencies not already present in the code or docs.

# Brave Web Search

> **🎯 DEFAULT TOOL: `brave_llm_context_search`**
>
> **For almost all searches, use `brave_llm_context_search`.** It returns pre-extracted, relevant text content ready for synthesis — not just links and snippets. This is what you want 90% of the time.
>
> **Only use alternatives when:**
> - You need **time-filtered results** → `brave_web_search` (supports `freshness` parameter)
> - You need **recent news** → `brave_news_search`
>
> **IGNORE these tools** (not relevant for coding):
> - `brave_image_search`, `brave_video_search`, `brave_local_search`

## Overview

Brave provides privacy-focused web search with an independent index. Use for general research, news, comparisons, and non-code technical content.

**`brave_llm_context_search` is the primary tool** — it returns actual page content, pre-extracted and relevance-scored, ready for you to synthesize. No need to fetch URLs separately.

**Remember:** For code examples, API docs, and debugging — use Exa's `get_code_context_exa` instead.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Priority | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `brave_llm_context_search` | **⭐ PRIMARY** | Pre-extracted content, token-controlled, ready for synthesis |
| `brave_web_search` | Fallback | When you need freshness filtering (time-based) |
| `brave_news_search` | News only | Recent announcements and current events |
| `brave_image_search` | ❌ IGNORE | Not relevant for coding |
| `brave_video_search` | ❌ IGNORE | Not relevant for coding |
| `brave_local_search` | ❌ IGNORE | Not relevant for coding |

## When to Use Which Tool

| Query Type | Tool | Why |
|------------|------|-----|
| **Most searches** | `brave_llm_context_search` | **Returns actual content, not just links** |
| General research | `brave_llm_context_search` | Pre-extracted, relevance-scored |
| Comparisons and reviews | `brave_llm_context_search` | Full context for synthesis |
| Need results from specific time period | `brave_web_search` | Supports `freshness` param (pd/pw/pm/py) |
| News and announcements | `brave_news_search` | News-specific index |

### Limitation: `brave_llm_context_search` does NOT support freshness filtering

If you need results from a specific time period (last day, week, month), you must use `brave_web_search` with the `freshness` parameter:
- `pd` = past day
- `pw` = past week
- `pm` = past month
- `py` = past year

## Token Budget for `brave_llm_context_search`

Configure based on context needs:

| Use Case | Token Budget |
|----------|-------------|
| Quick lookup | 1024-2048 tokens |
| Detailed research | 4096-8192 tokens |
| Comprehensive analysis | 16384-32768 tokens |

## Version Awareness (Critical)

Before searching, determine which version of a library/API you're working with:

1. Check `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, etc.
2. Look at existing imports and usage patterns in the codebase
3. **Always include the version in your search query**

**Bad:** "React useEffect cleanup"
**Good:** "React 18 useEffect cleanup"

**Bad:** "Kubernetes pod networking"
**Good:** "Kubernetes 1.29 pod networking CNI"

**Bad:** "TypeScript decorators"
**Good:** "TypeScript 5.0 decorators experimental"

## When to Use Brave vs Exa

| Use Brave For | Use Exa For |
|---------------|-------------|
| General research questions | Code examples and API docs |
| News and recent developments | Library documentation |
| Comparisons and reviews | Debugging errors |
| Privacy-sensitive searches | GitHub/StackOverflow content |
| Non-code technical content | Code-specific queries |

## Privacy Note

Brave operates an independent search index with strong privacy practices:
- No user tracking
- No user profiling
- Independent from Google/Bing

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Using `brave_web_search` by default** | **Use `brave_llm_context_search` — it returns actual content** |
| Using `brave_llm_context_search` for time-filtered search | Use `brave_web_search` with `freshness` param |
| Using Brave for code search | Use Exa's `get_code_context_exa` for code |
| Using Brave for API documentation | Use Exa's `get_code_context_exa` for technical docs |
| Using `brave_image_search` | Ignore — not relevant for coding |
| Using `brave_video_search` | Ignore — not relevant for coding |
| Using `brave_local_search` | Ignore — not relevant for coding |
| Searching without version | Always check and include library version |
| Not checking project deps first | Always check package.json/requirements.txt first |
| Not setting token budget | Configure `maximumNumberOfTokens` based on context needs |
